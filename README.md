# sport_data_scraper
The aim is to make tools to build a database of sport results &amp; stats &amp; odds from various sources.

File contents:
- separate functions in separate R scripts (later will contain documentation created with roxygen)
- functions used for scraping named as 'data_source'_'result_of_a_function'.R, e.g. flashscore_match_stats.R

TO DO (the list will be updated):
1. Scrape data from flashscore.com (match results, history, statistics)
2. Scrape time series of odds from oddsportal.com (and/or betexplorer.com)
3. Scrape market value and injuries history of football players from transfermarkt.de
